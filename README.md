# HighOrder
High order Hermite integrators with dd_real datatype

This is a test code for the 4th-, 6th-, 8th-, 10th-, 12th-, 14th, and 16-th order Hermite integrators.

## Requirement
QD library is available from
 http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~dhbailey/mpdist/
Only the header files are required.
I recommend to configure it with FMA enabled if your CPU supports that (after Haswell architecrure).
